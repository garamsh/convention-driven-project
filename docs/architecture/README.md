# Architecture

What the system is made of and why it is shaped this way. Workers read this before touching code; the PM keeps it honest.

## Contents

- `overview.md` — module list: each module with a one-sentence responsibility
- `adr/` — architecture decision records, one file per decision

## Rules

- Describe structure with lists of paths and short sentences. No diagrams.
- Record *why* in ADRs, *what* in the overview. Never record *how* — that is the code's job.
- A PR that changes module boundaries updates `overview.md`; a PR that changes a decision adds an ADR. Same PR, always.
