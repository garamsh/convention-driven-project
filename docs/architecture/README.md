# Architecture

Current architecture of the system and the decisions behind it. This file is the index; workers read it before touching code, the PM keeps it honest.

## Structure

- **Responsibility documents** (one `.md` per domain or concern, e.g. `memory.md`, `gateway.md`) — the single source of truth for how the system is shaped *now*. To know the current state, read only these.
- **`adr/`** — the record of individual decisions: direction taken, context, rejected alternatives.
- **`structures/`** — one file per candidate architecture, read side by side at bootstrap to choose the shape the system takes. These are input to that decision and not a record of it: the choice is recorded as an ADR carrying the chosen file's §Signs the choice was wrong, that file's §Boundaries and dependency direction becomes `structure.md` (rules 6 and 7) beside §Rules every shape carries, and bootstrap deletes this folder once both have landed, or, in a project that writes no `structure.md`, without waiting for them.

## Rules

1. **Responsibility document skeleton**: current decisions (consolidated) / rationale summary with links to the relevant ADRs / open questions. Do not copy ADR content — synthesize the present state.
2. **ADRs are append-only.** Once merged, the body is frozen. Exceptions: updating the status field (`accepted` → `superseded by ADR-XXXX`), fixing typos or broken links, and appending a dated entry under `## Errata` when the decision stands but a fact supporting it was wrong — the erratum names what falsified it, and the original text stays intact. A changed decision means a new ADR that supersedes the old one — never an edit.
3. **Decisions land in pairs.** A PR that adds or supersedes an ADR must update the affected responsibility documents in the same PR. A PR with only one of the two is rejected — the final state must always live in the responsibility documents.
4. Keep this index current: every responsibility document and every ADR is listed here. `structures/` is not — bootstrap deletes it, and an entry for a file that is about to go leaves the index wrong. An ADR covers a decision that changes a project rule — a settled choice that does not affect the rules does not earn one.
5. **Every domain or concern has a responsibility document.** The PR that introduces one adds its document; the PR that removes one deletes it. A system with no code yet has no more than `structure.md` (rule 6), and that is the correct state.
6. **Structural rules live in `structure.md`.** The shape chosen at bootstrap imposes rules — what the unit is, what may reference what, when a new one is earned — and they belong in the responsibility document for that concern, where a reviewer cites one by line and a correction is an ordinary edit. Not the ADR: rule 2 freezes that body, so superseding the choice of shape would be the price of fixing a rule's wording.
7. **A point the structural rules leave to the project is settled in an ADR** — the one recording the shape where the question is met at bootstrap, a later one where it is met later. Which side is taken decides what counts as a defect, so it is a decision under rule 4, and the ADR still holds the record after bootstrap. Nothing obliges a project to settle a question it has not met: until then the point waits under `structure.md`'s open questions, where it binds nothing, and moves into that document's current decisions when the project takes a side.
8. **Structural rules yield only to what a framework imposes.** Where `structure.md` and a convention file decide the same case differently, `structure.md` governs, unless the stack-specific file that applies decides it as its framework imposes it — the alternative fails to build or run, so the project cannot restate it. A stack file's spelling of a structural rule is not that: the rule it spells is `structure.md`'s. The shape chosen at bootstrap is this project's own refinement of what a stack-neutral file states for every project. A project with no `structure.md` meets no such conflict, and this rule asks nothing of it.

## Rules every shape carries

Structural rules that read the same whatever the unit is, so no candidate under `structures/` states them. Like that folder, this section is input to `structure.md` and not a record of it: a project that takes it in from the template, at bootstrap or later, copies every bullet into `structure.md` beside the chosen shape's §Boundaries and dependency direction, where they live under rule 6, and deletes this section once `structure.md` carries them. A project with no `structure.md` has nowhere to copy them: it copies nothing and deletes this section.

- **The application has one composition site.** It is the one place that constructs concrete implementations, and it decides which implementation each declared abstraction receives.
- **Every other unit receives what it depends on and constructs none of it**, whatever the shape makes the unit — a domain, a layer, or an adapter.
- **The composition site stays thin.** It constructs and passes; it decides nothing else.
