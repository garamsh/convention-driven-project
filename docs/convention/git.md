# Git Conventions

How branches, commits, and PR titles are written, and what survives a merge.

## Branches

- `feat/<short-name>` — new behavior
- `fix/<short-name>` — bug fixes
- `chore/<short-name>` — tooling, config, dependencies
- `docs/<short-name>` — documentation only

One task, one branch. Branch from `main`; never commit to `main` directly.

## Commits

Only the PR title reaches `main`. A branch's commits are squashed away at merge, so they are a working record for the reviewer reading the branch, not the permanent history.

Format: `<type>: <imperative summary>`

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`
- Summary: imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period. `fix: reject empty tokens`, not `fixed some bugs`.
- One concern per commit. If a change needs "and" to describe it, split it.
- Omit the body unless the reason for the change is invisible in the diff. A body never restates what changed.
- The message contains only what the project put there. Tooling does not append trailers, footers, or attribution lines.
- Reversing an earlier decision mid-branch is an ordinary commit describing the new state. Earlier commits are not rewritten to hide that the decision changed.

## PRs

- Title follows the commit format: `<type>: <imperative summary>`. It becomes the commit on `main`, so it is the permanent record of the change.
- Body follows `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- PRs are squash-merged. Branch commits do not appear on `main`; do not rewrite them to be pretty.
